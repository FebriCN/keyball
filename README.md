# Keyball Series

The original README please check [here](https://github.com/Yowkees/keyball).

I have been an HHKB user for 12 years, and when I came across the Keyball, I developed a strong interest in it.

So I bought one, and the story started.

I made my own keymap, [keyball44:easy](./qmk_firmware/keyboards/keyball/keyball44/keymaps/easy)
